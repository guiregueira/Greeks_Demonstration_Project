# Greeks_Demonstration_Project
In the last month, Caio and I developed a Python script capable of deriving the Black &amp; Scholes equation and finding all Greeks' equations, including Third-degree Greeks.  In addition, we developed the graphic representation of these Greeks' behavior to variations in terms of time, implied volatility, dividends, risk-free rate, and stock price.  Moreover, in this study, we found new important greeks that weren't cataloged before. As an example, we named one of them as ''Tau'' (It's demonstrated and analyzed at the end of this report)
